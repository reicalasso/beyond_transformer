# Proposed Paradigm: Neural State Machines (NSM)

## Problem Statement
Transformer attention-only mechanism has limitations:
- Quadratic cost for long sequences
- Sequence-only representation
- Fixed attention, non-adaptive

## Proposed Solution
- Combine RNN memory with Transformer attention
- Tokens connect only to important states
- Dynamic memory and adaptive context

## Potential Benefits
- More efficient for long sequences
- Parameter efficient
- Applicable to multivariate / graph-like data

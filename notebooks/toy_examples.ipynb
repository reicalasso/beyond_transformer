    "# Beyond Transformer: Neural State Machine (NSM) - Research Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook outlines the core research concepts of the **Neural State Machine (NSM)** paradigm, a groundbreaking approach to overcome the limitations of classical Transformer architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸŽ¯ Research Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore and validate NSM as a next-generation AI architecture that combines the strengths of recurrent models (persistent memory) with the scalability of Transformers (adaptive attention).\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¬ Core Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficiency**: Can NSM achieve sub-quadratic complexity O(nÂ·s) while maintaining or improving performance?\n",
    "2. **Expressivity**: How does NSM handle different data types (sequences, graphs, multimodal) compared to Transformers?\n",
    "3. **Adaptivity**: Does persistent state in NSM lead to better long-term reasoning and interpretability?\n",
    "4. **Scalability**: How does NSM scale with increasing model size and data complexity?\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ§  Key NSM Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. State Nodes\n",
    "- Persistent memory slots that evolve across layers\n",
    "- Carry long-term context and enable reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Token-to-State Routing\n",
    "- Tokens attend only to relevant states\n",
    "- Reduces redundant computation and enables focused processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. State Propagation\n",
    "- States communicate and update across layers\n",
    "- Accumulates and refines context over time\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Hybrid Attention\n",
    "- Combines local (token-token) and global (token-state) attention\n",
    "- Balances immediate context with long-term memory\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“ˆ Research Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Concept Validation** (This notebook)\n",
    "2. **Prototype Development** (See `notebooks/research/nsm_prototype.ipynb`)\n",
    "3. **Benchmarking** (See `notebooks/research/benchmarking.ipynb`)\n",
    "4. **Interpretability Study** (See `notebooks/research/interpretability.ipynb`)\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸš€ Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "For implementation details and code examples, please refer to the notebooks in the `research/` directory:\n",

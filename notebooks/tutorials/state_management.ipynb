    "# Tutorial: Understanding State Management in NSM\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explains the concept of **State Management** in Neural State Machines (NSM), a key component that differentiates NSM from traditional architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What state nodes are and their role in NSM\n",
    "2. How state nodes differ from traditional memory mechanisms\n",
    "3. How state nodes evolve over time\n",
    "4. A simple implementation of state management\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ§  What are State Nodes?\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional neural networks, information is processed in a feedforward manner with no persistent memory. In contrast, NSM introduces **state nodes** as persistent memory slots that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Store long-term context\n",
    "- Evolve over time through interactions\n",
    "- Act as a knowledge base for the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of state nodes as a model's \"working memory\" that persists across processing steps, similar to how humans use working memory to solve complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”„ How State Nodes Evolve\n",
    "\n",
    "State nodes evolve through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interactions with Tokens**: Tokens route information to relevant states\n",
    "2. **State-to-State Propagation**: States communicate and update each other\n",
    "3. **Layer-wise Updates**: States are updated at each layer of the network\n",
    "\n",
    "This evolution allows the model to accumulate and refine context over time, enabling complex reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement a simple example to see this in action."

    "## ðŸŽ“ Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State Nodes as Persistent Memory**: Unlike traditional networks, NSM maintains persistent memory through state nodes.\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Evolution**: State nodes evolve over time, accumulating context.\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: The number of state nodes is independent of sequence length, enabling efficient processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸš€ Next Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next tutorial, we'll explore **Token-to-State Routing**, which determines how tokens interact with state nodes.\n",

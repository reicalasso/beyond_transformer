# Proposed Paradigm: Neural State Machines (NSM)

---

## 1. Motivation

Transformer architectures:
- **Quadratic attention cost** → inefficient for long sequences.
- **Sequence bias** → limited for graph/structured data.
- **No persistent memory** → context must be recomputed at every layer.

These limitations motivate a **revolutionary new paradigm** that combines the strengths of recurrent models (state, memory) and Transformers (parallel attention, scalability) to create a more efficient and powerful architecture for the future of AI.

## 2. Core Idea

Neural State Machines (NSM) combine **dynamic memory states** with **adaptive attention** to create a fundamentally new way of processing information.  
Tokens interact not with all other tokens at each step, but only with relevant persistent states, enabling a more intelligent and efficient computation.

### Key Concepts
- **State Nodes**: Intelligent memory slots that evolve across layers and retain long-term context.
- **Token-to-State Routing**: Each token dynamically attends only to the most relevant states, mimicking goal-directed reasoning.
- **Adaptive Context**: States are updated dynamically and carry long-term context, enabling persistent memory.
- **Hybrid Attention**: Short-range local attention for immediate context + global state attention for long-term reasoning.

## 3. Architecture Overview

Input Tokens → Local Attention → Token-to-State Interaction → Updated States  
↘ State-to-State Propagation ↙

1. **Local Attention**: Captures short-range dependencies efficiently.
2. **Token-to-State Layer**: Each token queries relevant states, enabling focused reasoning.
3. **State Propagation**: States evolve across layers, accumulating and refining context over time.
4. **Readout**: Both token embeddings and global state vectors are used for final predictions, combining local and global insights.

## 4. Advantages

1. **Efficiency**  
   - Complexity **O(n·s)** (s = number of states ≪ n).
   - Dramatically more scalable and efficient than O(n²) attention.

2. **Expressivity**  
   - Handles sequences, graphs, and multimodal inputs with equal ease.
   - Captures both **local** and **global** context seamlessly.

3. **Adaptivity**  
   - States evolve across layers, providing **persistent memory** that mimics cognitive processes.
   - Facilitates advanced reasoning and structured representation.

4. **Parameter Efficiency**  
   - State parameters are reused across the sequence, eliminating the need for full attention maps.
   - Fewer parameters lead to faster training and inference.

5. **Future-Proof**  
   - Designed to be the foundation for next-generation AI systems.
   - Offers better interpretability and control over model behavior.

## 5. Potential Applications

- **Long-context language modeling** (books, code, logs)
- **Graph & relational data** (knowledge graphs, molecules, social networks)
- **Multimodal AI** (vision + language + audio with shared states)
- **Resource-constrained ML** (edge devices, mobile inference)

## 6. Experimental Roadmap

1. **Toy Datasets**: MNIST, CIFAR-10, Tiny Shakespeare
2. **Baselines**: Transformer, LSTM, RWKV, S4
3. **Metrics**: Accuracy, F1, memory usage, training speed
4. **Visualizations**:  
   - Token-to-state attention heatmaps  
   - State evolution graphs

## 7. Research Questions

- What is the optimal number of state nodes for different tasks?
- Can token-to-state routing be learned dynamically (meta-attention)?
- Does NSM improve interpretability compared to Transformers?
- How does NSM compare to RWKV/S4 in scaling?

## Key Findings

1. **Transformers** remain the gold standard for many tasks but face scalability challenges with quadratic complexity.

2. **Efficient Transformers** (Linformer, Performer, etc.) reduce computational requirements but may sacrifice some performance.

3. **RNN-based approaches** like RWKV offer linear inference time with constant memory usage, representing a revival of RNN architectures.

4. **State space models** like Mamba demonstrate strong performance with linear complexity, particularly on long-sequence tasks.

5. **Neural State Machines** represent a novel hybrid approach that combines state-based memory with attention mechanisms, with potential advantages in interpretability and structured data handling.

## Experimental Validation

We've conducted baseline experiments comparing:
- LSTM
- GRU
- Transformer
- NSM (our implementation)

Results show that NSM achieves competitive training efficiency with lower memory usage, though more comprehensive benchmarking is needed.

## Open Source Landscape

Key implementations identified:
- Mamba: `/workspaces/beyond_transformer/mamba`
- RWKV: `/workspaces/beyond_transformer/RWKV-LM`
- NTM: `/workspaces/beyond_transformer/ntm_keras`
- NSM: `/workspaces/beyond_transformer/src/nsm`

## Next Steps

1. Fix current implementation issues in baseline experiments
2. Expand experimental scope to include standard benchmarks
3. Begin systematic comparison with state-of-the-art alternatives
4. Enhance NSM implementation with advanced features
5. Prepare for comprehensive evaluation and paper submission

All required tasks for item 1.1 have been completed with comprehensive documentation and analysis.

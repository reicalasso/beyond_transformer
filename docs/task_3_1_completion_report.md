   - Falls back to a simplified implementation when Mamba is not available
   - Supports configurable model dimensions, state dimensions, and expansion factors

2. **NTMMemory** (`src/nsm/modules/ntm_memory.py`)
   - Implements Neural Turing Machine memory operations
   - Supports content-based addressing with read/write heads
   - Includes erase and add vector operations
   - Configurable memory size, dimension, and number of heads

3. **TransformerAttention** (`src/nsm/modules/transformer_attention.py`)

- NTMMemory: Read vectors [2, 1, 20], Memory [128, 20]
- TransformerAttention: Input [2, 10, 64] â†’ Output [2, 10, 64]
- RNNMemory: Input [2, 10, 64] â†’ Output [2, 10, 128]

### Usage Examples

```python
# SSMBlock
from nsm import SSMBlock
ssm = SSMBlock(d_model=64, d_state=16)
output = ssm(input_tensor)

# NTMMemory
from nsm import NTMMemory
ntm = NTMMemory(mem_size=128, mem_dim=20)
read_vectors, memory = ntm(read_keys, write_keys, ...)

# TransformerAttention
from nsm import TransformerAttention
attn = TransformerAttention(d_model=64, num_heads=8)
output, weights = attn.forward_self_attention(input_tensor)

# RNNMemory
from nsm import RNNMemory
rnn = RNNMemory(input_dim=64, hidden_dim=128, rnn_type='lstm')
output, hidden = rnn(input_tensor, initial_hidden)
```

### Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Performance Optimization**: CUDA kernels for custom operations
2. **Advanced NTM Features**: Location-based addressing, temporal memory
3. **Hybrid Integration**: Combining components for advanced architectures
4. **Additional RNN Types**: Peephole LSTM, custom RNN cells
5. **Attention Variants**: Sparse attention, linear attention

## Conclusion

Task 3.1 has been successfully completed with the implementation of all four core components. Each component is fully functional, well-tested, and integrated into the NSM architecture. The components are ready for use in building more complex Neural State Machine models and can be combined in various ways to create hybrid architectures as defined in the integration strategy.
